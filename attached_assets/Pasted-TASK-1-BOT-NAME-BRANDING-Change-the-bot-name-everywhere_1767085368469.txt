TASK 1: BOT NAME & BRANDING
	•	Change the bot name everywhere from “OmniTrending” to “DexTools Trending Bot”
	•	Update all occurrences including:
	•	Bot title / display name
	•	Welcome messages
	•	Menu headers
	•	Payment messages
	•	Any hardcoded text, constants, comments, README, or config values
	•	Do NOT change the bot logic or flow, only rename branding references.

TASK 2: CHAINS CONFIGURATION
	•	Keep all existing supported chains EXCEPT remove Arbitrum completely
	•	Ensure Arbitrum is removed from:
	•	Chain selection menus
	•	Chain enums/constants
	•	Validation logic
	•	Payment routing
	•	Any chain-based conditionals
	•	Remaining chains must continue to work normally across the entire bot.

TASK 3: PRICING UPDATE (GLOBAL, ALL CHAINS)
Replace all old pricing logic with the following new pricing tiers and apply them consistently for every supported chain:
	•	3 HOURS → 2.5 SOL
	•	6 HOURS → 6.5 SOL
	•	12 HOURS → 10 SOL
	•	24 HOURS → 15 SOL

Make sure:
	•	Prices are updated in menus, buttons, confirmations, invoices, and validation checks
	•	Duration labels remain unchanged (3H, 6H, 12H, 24H)
	•	No legacy prices remain anywhere in the codebase

TASK 4: PAYMENT WALLET ADDRESSES
Replace all existing payment addresses with the following, applied globally:
	•	SOLANA (SOL):
AGN5AWVWWY3XxfqSnVDPgzcZRWHTHaunbp1ZkE8htaQm
	•	BNB (BSC):
0x7042ED5C8e93B5afAEC6eE6c03B83aaD61aC4446
	•	ETHEREUM (ETH):
0x7042ED5C8e93B5afAEC6eE6c03B83aaD61aC4446
	•	BASE:
0x7042ED5C8e93B5afAEC6eE6c03B83aaD61aC4446

Ensure:
	•	No old wallet addresses remain anywhere
	•	Payment verification logic still maps correctly to each chain
	•	SOL uses the Solana address only
	•	EVM chains reuse the same EVM address as specified

TASK 5: SUPPORT CONTACT UPDATE
	•	Replace the existing support contact with:
@DEXToolsTrend_Support
	•	Update this everywhere:
	•	Support buttons
	•	Help messages
	•	Error messages
	•	Footer text
	•	Remove any previous support usernames entirely.

TASK 6: FINAL CHECKS
	•	Do NOT change bot architecture, database schema, or flow
	•	Keep all existing features working
	•	Ensure naming, pricing, chains, wallets, and support are consistent across:
	•	Start command
	•	Inline buttons
	•	Callbacks
	•	Payment confirmations
	•	Admin or logging messages if present

Once complete, run a quick search to confirm:
	•	“OmniTrending” no longer exists
	•	Old prices no longer exist
	•	Arbitrum references no longer exist
	•	Old wallet addresses no longer exist
